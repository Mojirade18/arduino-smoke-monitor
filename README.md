## üí° Arduino Code

```cpp
void setup() {
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT); // Set pin 13 as output
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(13, HIGH); // Turn the LED on
  delay(500);             // Wait 0.5 second
  digitalWrite(13, LOW);  // Turn the LED off
  delay(500);             // Wait 0.5 second
}
